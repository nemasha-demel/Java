Abstraction
    *Abstract class
    *Interface

Abstract Class -  can contains abstract methods and non abstract methods.Can't create objects within the class. To call abstract methods and other methods this class must be inherited by another class.

Abstract Method - Methods without body. No implementation

Interface - Only contains abstract methods. Can't create objects within the class. 
            If we create a variable inside the interface, the variable becomes a final value. It means we can't change the value of the variable.
            When we are implementing methods(creating the body) the methods should be public. In interface it doesn't matter.
            Also we can create objects of interface class from implemented class.
